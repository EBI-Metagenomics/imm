- Fix the "suspicious usage of sizeof(sizeof(...))" caused whenever we use the macro `cco_hash_for_each_possible`
- imm_state_name should return char* instead of unsigned
- normalise names: seqlen -> seqsize, emislen -> emissize, emission_length -> emission_size, etc.
- imm_hmm_write_dot should be imm_hmm_dump instead
- assert that not transitions points to the starting state
- would be nice to start e end state having indices [0, last_one]
- compiler.h macros are too much
- have a schematic way to debug (specially debug viterbi and trellis)
- remove state_table dependency from trellis so it can be used more easily by other libraries
